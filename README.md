# Creating a Support Package for Codefresh Runner

## PreReqs

1. `kubectl config current-context` must be the context of the cluster the runner is located in
2. [Codefresh CLI](https://codefresh-io.github.io/cli/installation/) must be installed and configured
3. jq (used to gather information)
3. git (can download a zip version instead)

## Script Usage

This script is to gather information about the Codefresh Runner (previously Venona) environment.  

### Setup

To begin, you will need to clone the repo, change the directory to this repo, and add execution flag to the script.  Below is the command to do it all in one go.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codefresh-contrib/venona-support.git && \
cd venona-support && \
chmod +x support_package.sh
```

### Syntax

```bash
./support_package.sh "Codefresh/Runtime" AGENT-NAMESPACE
```

The 1st argument is the runtime name. You can run `codefresh get runtime-environments` to get the runtimes.

> NOTE: make sure the runtime name is in `""` because of the `/` character.

The 2nd is the Kubernetes Namespace where the Codefresh Agent is located. Only use if it is in a different namespace than the runtime environment. The AGENT-NAMESPACE argument is not required.

Example:

```bash
./support_package.sh "sales-dev-eks/codefresh-runtime"
```

```bash
./support_package.sh "sales-dev-eks/codefresh-runtime" codefresh-namespace
```
